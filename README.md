I'm thrilled to share a project I've been working on: a Basic Banking System. This simple dynamic website allows for seamless money transfers between users without the need for login or user creation. Hereâ€™s a quick overview of the project:

Key Features:
1.Database Setup:
 - Created dummy data for up to 10 customers using MySQL, MongoDB, or Postgres.
 - Customers table includes basic fields: name, email, current balance, etc.
 - Transfers table records all transactions.

2. Website Flow:
 - Home Page: Overview and navigation.
 - View All Customers: Display a list of all customers.
 - View One Customer: Select and view details of a specific customer.
 - Transfer Money: Transfer money between customers.
 - Select Customer to Transfer To: Choose the recipient from the customer list.
 - View All Customers: Review updated customer balances after the transfer.



This project is a great way to get hands-on experience with database management, backend development, and deployment on various platforms. Whether you're a beginner or looking to brush up on your skills, this project has something for everyone.
